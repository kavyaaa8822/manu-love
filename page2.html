        Happy Birthday 🤍

Today feels a little more special, because it reminds me of you and all the quiet moments my heart has held onto.
On this day, I just wanted to share a small part of what I’ve felt for a long time.

For the past three years, I’ve loved you quietly and truly.
You may not know it, but I miss you more than words can say, and your smile has been a silent comfort to me.

This love never asked for anything in return.
It only wished for your happiness, peace, and success.
Even from a distance, my heart still celebrates you today.

Happy Birthday.
You will always be special to me ✨🎂

        Stay the wonderful person you are.  
        Today is special — because *you* were born 🌸
